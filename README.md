***Hi there 👋, I am Chibuzo Nmecha**

I am studying to become a software developer! So far, my journey has been based on Marine Navigation systems, and while that has been nice, pushing boundaries and expanding my capabilities hasn't been challenging. I was missing the excitement of getting out there and making a difference while contributing to something meaningful. Transitioning into the tech space and learning new skills has been challenging and exciting at the same time, and I am excited to see where this journey takes me and can't wait to share more with you.
